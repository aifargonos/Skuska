Skuska
======

Just a bunch of random try-outs. The work "skuska" can be translated as "a try-out".
I use this word to name projects whose purpose is to only try out some concept, language, paradigm, stuff, or things ;-)

So folders in this repository are a skuska projects. They may be even organized in some structure :-P
